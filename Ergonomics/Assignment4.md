# Gamification case study

## Part1 - Khan Academy
### Gamified process used in Khan Academy
During the learning process on Khan Academy a series of badges can be unlocked. These badges have different unlock conditions including watch video for certain period of time, finish quizzes and complete a course. When condition is fulfilled the corresponded badge will light up and displayed under user profile.

### Motivation of gamifying this process
In the modern age of technology stimulus are every around us especially on an online platform. It is challenging to keep users attention. In addition, study is a boring process so it is even harder to be concentrated. By implementing a badges system users can be reworded during study which improves user engagement and motivation.[^1]
