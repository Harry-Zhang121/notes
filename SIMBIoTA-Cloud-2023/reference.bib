abstract="While the Internet of things (IoT) promises to improve areas such as energy efficiency, health care, and transportation, it is highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. In particular, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks overload the bandwidth of a server. But many IoT devices form part of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Therefore, they can be used to launch ``physical'' denial-of-service attacks (PDoS) in which IoT devices overflow the ``physical bandwidth'' of a CPS. In this paper, we quantify the population-based risk to a group of IoT devices targeted by malware for a PDoS attack. In order to model the recruitment of bots, we develop a ``Poisson signaling game,'' a signaling game with an unknown number of receivers, which have varying abilities to detect deception. Then we use a version of this game to analyze two mechanisms (legal and economic) to deter botnet recruitment. Equilibrium results indicate that (1) defenders can bound botnet activity, and (2) legislating a minimum level of security has only a limited effect, while incentivizing active defense can decrease botnet activity arbitrarily. This work provides a quantitative foundation for proactive PDoS defense.",

abstract = {Summary Because of the rapid increasing of malware attacks on the Internet of Things in recent years, it is critical for resource-constrained devices to guard against potential risks. The traditional host-based security solution becomes puffy and inapplicable with the development of malware attacks. Moreover, it is hard for the cloud-based security solution to achieve both the high performance detection and the data privacy protection simultaneously. This paper proposes a cloud-based anti-malware system, called CloudEyes, which provides efficient and trusted security services for resource-constrained devices. For the cloud server, CloudEyes presents suspicious bucket cross-filtering, a novel signature detection mechanism based on the reversible sketch structure, which provides retrospective and accurate orientations of malicious signature fragments. For the client, CloudEyes implements a lightweight scanning agent which utilizes the digest of signature fragments to dramatically reduce the range of accurate matching. Furthermore, by transmitting sketch coordinates and the modular hashing, CloudEyes guarantees both the data privacy and low-cost communications. Finally, we evaluate the performance of CloudEyes by utilizing both the campus suspicious traffic and normal files. The results demonstrate that the mechanisms in CloudEyes are effective and practical, and our system can outperform other existing systems with less time and communication consumption.
