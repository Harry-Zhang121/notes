### Describe someone you know who often helps others
You should say:
What he/she is like
How he/she helps others
Why his/her help is beneficial
And explain why he/she helps others

Teachers and professors are well known as people who help others, helping students is their intrinsic duty. One of my professor, Dr Levi, the one that I worked closely with is a perfect example. He is a middle age man, a little bit short and husky, with a constant serious face. When it comes to educators the main method of providing help would be by giving lectures. However, I never attend any lectures given by Dr Levi. Despite of that I still learned a lot from him during our collaborative project. 
His way of helping students is very unique, instead of giving step-by-step instructions he gave me a lot of freedom to explore our research topic and guide me to the right track when I lost direction. As an experienced researcher he provided so many useful insights and methodology during my research project and paper writing.
I once interviewed him about why he became a professor to help students. He answered in an unexpected perspective. He said "unfortunately human can not inherit memory from our ancestors so the only way of keeping our knowledge is by education. Someone have to be this role to push the civilization of humanity." I think this perfectly explains his motivation.

### Describe a traditional celebration in your country that you enjoy

My favorite traditional celebration must be the Chinese new year which also known as the Lunar new year. This is undoubtedly the most significant holiday in China, with centuries-old customs and traditions.
Despite the year-crossing moment is very short, the celebration of Chinese new year spans multiple days. We start this period by cleaning our house inside out since you don't want to carry any dirt to the new year. After that we usually decorate our house with red paper cutouts which symbolizing prosperity and good luck. As the night comes it's the time for my little brother's favorite acticity - fire work. I used to enjoyed it so much when I was a kid. The bright and colorful fire works and loud explosion creat a unique atmosphere of the new year.
I celebrate this festival with my entire family. This is a precious opportunity of family reunion. As a student studying aboard I can't visit my family very often. However my winter holiday happens to overlap with the Chinese new year which is a perfect opportunity to spend some qulity time with by grand parents and my little brother.
As for the reason why I enjoy it. As I mentioned earlier I spend a huge portion of the year in a different country with different culture. So being able to get back to my home town and practice these traditions connects my back to my cultural root.
