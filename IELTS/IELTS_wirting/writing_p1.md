## My essay

In modern era electronic devices such as smart phones and computers are getting increasing accessable by teenagers. Such devices can help with child education while they can also have negative impact on children. However I believe the overall effect is positive if we can manage the usage of these devices.

First of all, electronic devices can help children to learn new knowladge. The internet provided a veriaty of learning materials such as encyclopedia, dictionary and educational videos. One can esaily access the knowladge base of entire humanity by searching on the web. These information are also constantly updated which asure they are correct and up-to-date. In addition, learning with the aid of smart devices can by more effective compare to other treditional method since smart devices often offers interactive learning in which they can provide feed back according to user input. A research paper pubished on a pyscological journal shows that people learn faster interactively compare to reading and listening.

On the other hande, using electronic devices could cause harm to children. Light emmited from digital screen may cause damage to eye-sight. This effect is more pronounced on younger groups because their body is still growing. Spending more time on digital devices also effect children's social health as they will spend less time play with others. An isolation environment is not ideal for developing social skills.

In conclusion electronic devices have both advantages and disadvantages. However the majority of devices do provide some utilities to manage child usage. I believe that we can utilize this powerful educational tool and also reduce the potencial negative effect by proper education, time managment and parental control.
