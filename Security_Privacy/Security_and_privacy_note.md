## Economics
$Risk = Likelihood * ImpactOfAttacks$

common view: Technology solves the problem
Why our system is still not secure:
**Misaligned economic incentives = selfish behavior goes against the technical goal of the system**

### Misaligned incentives1: no liability
Party that implement security != party that suffer

### Misaligned incentives2: free-riding

### Misaligned inventives3: Networks effects and monopolistic markets
Three properties:
- Network effect - value grows with user base
- High fixed costs and low marginal costs
- lock-in effect

>"Ship it by Tuesday, get it right by version 3"


### Misaligned inventives4: Information asymmetry
If the market is **not transparant** --- Bad products drive out good products
example: firewall products
