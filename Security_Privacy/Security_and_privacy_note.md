## Attacks
### Passive attacks
Does not require active intervention into the operation of the system.
- trafic listening

### Active attacks
- man in the middle

## information security services
- Confientiality
- sth
- sth
- authenrication
- non-requdation

## Attacker's advantage
Attack
- cheap (1 vulnerability)
- proactive
- easy to measure the outcome
- illegal

Defense
- expensive (all vulnerability)
- reactive
- hard to measure
- must be lawful

## Economics
$Risk = Likelihood * ImpactOfAttacks$

common view: Technology solves the problem
Why our system is still not secure:
**Misaligned economic incentives = selfish behavior goes against the technical goal of the system**

### Misaligned incentives 1: no liability
Party that implement security != party that suffer

### Misaligned incentives 2: free-riding

### Misaligned incentives 3: Networks effects and monopolistic markets
Three properties:
- Network effect - value grows with user base
- High fixed costs and low marginal costs
- lock-in effect

>"Ship it by Tuesday, get it right by version 3"


### Misaligned incentives 4: Information asymmetry
If the market is **not transparent** --- Bad products drive out good products
example: firewall products


|Causes|Consequences|
|---|---|
|no liability|no security investments|
|monopolistic software|correlated events|
|asymmetric info|lemon market|
|interdependency|tragedy of common|


## Game theory
The study of strategic decision making.

### Best response

### Nesh equilibrium (NE)

### Price of Anarchy
measures how the efficiency of a system degrades due to selfish behavior of its agents
$$
PoA = \frac{Max_{s}}{Something}
$$

### Stackelberg Games
In classical games the players act simultaneously. In Stac. games the leader moves first and the follower moves afterward.



## Microeconomics
### How normal market works?
- Firms typically have fixed costs and variable costs, so the average cost of goods initially falls without output.
### ICT market
- Information is an experience product
- Must be sampled, but never buy it twice.
- vast amount of information --- **filtering** is crucial
