## What is the difference between evaluation and valuation?
**Evaluation**: description of the environment – qualitative or quantitative.

**Valuation**: monetary valuation, “calculate the price of natural resources.


## List three potential problems of environmental impact assessment
- lack of independence from the proposers
- failure to assess alternatives to the proposal adequately
- incomprehensibility to lay-people
- failure to consider social factors
- general lack of public involvement in the decision-making process
- took place too late to have any real influence on the project
- narrowness, tended to ignore global and regional issues

## Define ecological footprint and biocapacity
**Ecological footprint**: The biologically productive area needed (demand) to provide for everything people use: fruits and vegetables, fish, wood, fibers, absorption of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel use, and space for buildings and roads.

**Biocapacity**: is the productive area that can regenerate what people demand from nature
